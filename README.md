## 👋 Hi, I'm [당신의 이름]!

I'm currently growing into a **UI-centered app/web developer**.  
From a long-time office worker to a full-time learner of software development,  
I made a bold choice to follow what I truly enjoy – **building beautiful and useful apps**.

🌱 I'm learning and developing with:
- **Flutter (Dart)** for cross-platform mobile apps  
- **JavaScript** and **HTML/CSS** for building responsive web pages  
- Designing UI/UX directly from sketch to implementation

💡 I love how a single line of code can change an entire screen.  
I enjoy the process of **planning → structuring → building → testing → improving**.  
Especially, I’m interested in **UI design, front-end development**, and making **user-friendly interfaces**.

🛠 Current Project:
I'm building a **mental health support app** with:
- ✅ UI design, layout planning
- ✅ Dart + Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Pages for tests, community support, and local help programs

📚 I'm sharing what I learn on [My Blog](https://blog.naver.com/d1234b)  
🔎 Always curious. Always learning. Always building.
